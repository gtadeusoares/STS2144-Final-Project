# STS2144-Final-Project
# Description
For the final project, you will create a game book inspired by design fiction. Design fiction, “incorporates speculative fiction and prototyping, juxtaposing materials and narrative to visualize and start conversations about a particular scenario (Bleecker, 2009). We use it not to imagine a future technology necessarily but, drawing on Langdon Winner (1986), to imagine forms of life that might materialize.” 
                    
For this assignment, students will create a book in the format of “Welcome to Vanguard Estates,” a choose-your-own adventure style book that presents the ethical challenges relating to using artificial intelligence technology for care of the elderly. Your game book can take many forms, such as a word document, slides, an interactive web site, or an app. You will work on this project in small groups. 

**Your narrative should have:**

- characters 

- at least one technology 

- multiple decision points and endings (at least 3). 

For example, one negative or techno-dystopia ending, one uncertain, and one positive ending. 

Your book should also show ethical tensions that we have discussed in class and covered in the readings and assignments, such as tensions between respecting duty, virtue, and justice. You should also include a brief, one page summary at the end of your book that summarizes how your book illustrates ethical tensions and key concepts from course materials.
