            President Frank McDonnald and John Love dedicated 
            many years to the development of this project 
            (Frank was re-elected). Utilizing social media 
            to be transparent and involve people in their 
            decision was certainly not an easy task, but 
            the country did benefit from it in the long run. 
            Many roads were built for self-driving cars. 
            These roads allowed only for self driving 
            vehicles so that the trajectory and the 
            environment could be deterministic. And so, 
            there were very few issues in these roads 
            that were used primarily for the transportation 
            of materials and people across states. Inside 
            cities, people were still in charge of driving 
            their own cars due to the cityâ€™s more random nature. 
            The self-driving cars were simply not trusted to 
            operate fully in such an environment.
