            This story book relates the story of John Love, a 
            leader at the company Bright Cars, which is the 
            leading self-driving car company in the country of 
            Happy States of Neopolis, and Frank McDonnald, the 
            elected president of Neopolis. 
            <br><br>
            This semester, we discussed many different ethical 
            frameworks. Some that stood out to me the most were 
            utilitarianism and deontology. Utilitarianism seeks to maximize 
            some good for the greatest number of people, and to minimize losses 
            if possible. Deontology states that one’s actions are ruled by the 
            principles that they hold, and that some actions are always right 
            or wrong, regardless of the context. 
            <br><br>
            In my story book, readers can choose whether John Love is more of 
            a deontologist or an utilitarian. Since a person’s idea of the 
            highest good may differ according to their personality, the first 
            choice in the story book has the user choose whether John Love is 
            more of a duties guy or a relationship guy. The second choice in 
            the story book has the user pick whether John love is more of an 
            utilitarian or deontologist. Depending on the answer to these 
            questions, a different outcome will result. 
            <br><br>
            We are then introduced to President Frank McDonnald. I thought 
            I had to include a powerful political figure in this story 
            because in class we spent a considerable time discussing 
            whether the government should exert more pressure, intervene, 
            or regulate the big tech companies in the United States and 
            across the world. Therefore, the user may choose whether 
            president Frank takes more of a controlling approach or a 
            free-market approach. 
            <br><br>
            President Frank and John Love eventually meet. 
            The previous user choices have defined these characters’ 
            personalities, and so they arrive at different conclusions 
            in their meeting. The final choice for the user is to 
            decide the role that social media, big tech and mass media 
            will play in their implementation. I chose this because we 
            spent a considerable amount of time in class discussing the 
            influence social media, big tech, and mass media have on people. 
            <br><br>
            In total, there are four possible outcomes. One where the country 
            is controlled by the government, another where the country is 
            run by businesses, another where the country becomes polarized 
            due to social media, and a good ending, where people actually 
            take the trouble to communicate transparently.
