            Frank McDonnald had just graduated from 
            Think Well University’s law school, 
            the most prestigious law school of the 
            Happy States of Neopolis. Frank had made 
            many internships in law firms throughout 
            his time as a student. Frank was an incredibly 
            industrious and ambitious man. He was frustrated 
            with how things were in the Happy States of Neopolis 
            and so, growing in his heart each day during his college 
            years, he had the dream of one day becoming the president 
            of Happy States of Neopolis. Frank was a very skillful 
            politician, and so, after much hard work, one day he did 
            become the president of Neopolis. Here is how he did it:

                        Frank McDonnald knew that a country 
                        is only as good as its institutions. 
                        Every institution should play a part 
                        in contributing to society, and so, every 
                        institution should somehow be working for or 
                        with, and reporting to the government. 
                        Frank valued the importance of fair and just laws, 
                        a strong police force to be able to enforce those 
                        laws, a common educational curriculum so all citizens 
                        would share a common basis of knowledge, etc. In his 
                        campaign, Frank partnered with multiple institutions, 
                        promising them great power if he was elected.

                        Frank McDonnald knew that a country is run by money. 
                        Nothing can be done without money. 
                        Bad money management puts the country in debt. 
                        If the country is in debt, there is no way to 
                        innovate, and the country is stuck with paying 
                        bills instead of leading the world in innovation 
                        and business. Frank didn’t like government 
                        controlling institutions, he believed that 
                        the market should be free. And so, Frank 
                        became very popular with certain companies 
                        who funded him in exchange for free regulations 
                        once he was elected.
