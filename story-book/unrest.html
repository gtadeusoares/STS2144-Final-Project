            President Frank McDonnald and John Love 
            worked together in partnership with the 
            media to push forward their agenda without 
            the concern for the public’s opinion. With 
            the help of Tech Giants and the Mass Media, 
            the two of them were able to revolutionize 
            the country’s automobile industry in record 
            time. There were still, of course, some 
            accidents, but these were swept under the rug. 
            Finally, there was great unrest with the population 
            because many people felt shut down and unheard. 
            Videos began spreading on the internet that 
            exposed the government and industry’s hypocrisy, 
            and many people lost their trust in their country’s 
            institutions, leading to the polarization of political parties.
