            John grew in his communication skills each day. 
            He became more caring not only of his wife, 
            but also of those around him. He learned how to 
            be enthusiastic each day and to deeply care about 
            all of the people he spoke with. Over time, John 
            was greatly liked in his company. People would always 
            come and talk to him, and in talking to everyone, 
            John learned a lot about the different aspects 
            of the company. He climbed the ranks of his 
            company and was liked by all of his co-workers.
            <br><br>
            To his surprise, one day, Bright Car’s 
            CEO, Jack Durand, called him aside and told him 
            about this new opportunity that was going to change the world.  
            <br><br>
            <strong>Jack:</strong>
            “John, I always knew that self-driving cars 
            are the way to the future. That is why I started this 
            company even though I did not have a single dollar in 
            my pocket. Honestly, when I hired you, I did not see 
            anything special, but I really needed workers who 
            were willing to work for little. But the years have 
            passed and you have proved yourself in this company. 
            Through your warmth and generosity, everyone in the 
            company has grown to respect you, and you have learned 
            from everyone as well. And so I am excited to share with 
            you that the government wants to hire our company to mass-produce 
            the next generation of self-driving cars, and I am placing you 
            in charge of this operation! You will work in direct contact 
            with President Frank McDonald, the elected president of our 
            wonderful country, the Happy States of Neopolis.”
            <br><br>
            <strong>John:</strong>
            “I don’t know what to say, Jack. Thank you so much, 
            this is an honor. My wife will be so proud of me. 
            I would love to lead this operation. Thank you for 
            trusting me and I will not disappoint you.”
            <br><br>
            <strong>Jack:</strong>
            “Good. Now prepare a presentation tomorrow. 
            I will announce your promotion to the entire company. 
            Starting tomorrow you will have authority over every 
            single employee in this company, except for me, of 
            course. You will lead this project with the government, 
            which is our most important project, and I will focus 
            on managing our relations with our other private investors, 
            and that other bureaucratic stuff that you don’t care to hear about.”
            <br><br>
            <strong>John:</strong>
            “Sounds good, boss. I will present myself in 
            front of the company tomorrow morning.”
            <br><br>
            And so, after celebrating the news with his wife, 
            John prepared his presentation and presented himself 
            in front of the entire company. You missed the presentation 
            but here is what his co-workers got from it:

            <div class="d-flex gap-2 w-100 justify-content-between">
                <div>
                    <h6 class="mb-0">John Love is utilitarian</h6>
                    <p class="mb-0 opacity-75">
                        He is willing to listen to everyone in the 
                        company and his priority is to maximize the 
                        number of satisfied people in the company. 
                        It is clear that he has to manage different 
                        expectations, for example, with the government, 
                        with private investors, with the engineers, 
                        with the factory workers, etc. But in general, 
                        John will do his best to keep everyone happy, 
                        even if it comes at the expense of the general 
                        productivity of the company and the project.

                    <h6 class="mb-0">John Love is a deontologist</h6>
                    <p class="mb-0 opacity-75">
                        He has ideals which guide him in his 
                        life and in his conduct with people. 
                        John will certainly try to keep everyone 
                        happy, but his priority is with his 
                        co-workers, the people who will buy and 
                        ride in the cars his company produces, 
                        and the friends he made along the way. 
                        Also, there are certain things that John 
                        would never do, while there are other 
                        things that John would never fail to do. 
                        His ideals lead him in every decision, and 
                        he is inflexible about a decision once he’s 
                        made it. That makes him, the company, and 
                        this project highly efficient and productive.
