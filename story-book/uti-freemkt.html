        <p>
            Soon after Frank McDonnald came into the presidency, 
            the attention turned toward self-driving cars. 
            Jack Durand was a great entrepreneur who invested 
            all that he had in building the market for self-driving cars. 
            Bright Cars had grown to be the most successful company of 
            autonomous vehicles, and the entire population of the Happy 
            States of Neopolis was debating what should be the role of 
            autonomous vehicles in their society. Some objected to the 
            vehicles due to the high levels of accidents. Others were 
            eager to live in a technologically advanced society where 
            self-driving cars were incorporated into the society. 
            There was a great mix of fear and enthusiasm from the 
            country, and so Frank decided he should partner up with 
            Bright Cars to decide the countryâ€™s future regarding 
            autonomous vehicles. 
            <br><br>
            And so, President Frank McDonnald and 
            John Love met to discuss the future of the 
            Happy States of Neopolis. Here is what they decided:
            <br><br>
            The country should be run like a corporation. 
            Bright Cars should be free to do whatever is 
            most profitable for itself and for the government. 
            But they know that self-driving cars are dangerous 
            and unpredictable. Perhaps special roads could be built 
            where only autonomous cars are allowed to drive, to reduce 
            the randomness of events produced by human behavior. John 
            Love and Frank McDonnald know that they need to hear the 
            opinion of the people of the Happy States of Neopolis 
            regarding this issue. Whatever the outcome, at least 51% 
            of the people need to be happy with the decision, 
            and Bright Cars can implement the rest.
            <br><br>
            But how would this be implemented?

                        Utilize a social media campaign to

                        Bribe and finance all the major news media 
                        corporations to prevent them from ever 
                        red-flagging you, and to have their support 
                        in this project, as well as helping to crush 
                        anyone speaking out against it and labelling 
                        the opposition as extremists.

                        open to be criticized and improved by citizens. 
                        Allow all sorts of criticism and feedback from
