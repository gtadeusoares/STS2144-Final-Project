        <p>
            Soon after Frank McDonnald came into the presidency, 
            the attention turned toward self-driving cars. 
            Jack Durand was a great entrepreneur who invested 
            all that he had in building the market for self-driving cars. 
            Bright Cars had grown to be the most successful company of 
            autonomous vehicles, and the entire population of the Happy 
            States of Neopolis was debating what should be the role of 
            autonomous vehicles in their society. Some objected to the 
            vehicles due to the high levels of accidents. Others were 
            eager to live in a technologically advanced society where 
            self-driving cars were incorporated into the society. 
            There was a great mix of fear and enthusiasm from the 
            country, and so Frank decided he should partner up with 
            Bright Cars to decide the country’s future regarding 
            autonomous vehicles. 
            <br><br>
            And so, President Frank McDonnald and 
            John Love met to discuss the future of the 
            Happy States of Neopolis. Here is what they decided:
            <br><br>
            The country should be run like a corporation. 
            Corporations should be free to do whatever is most 
            profitable, because the wealthier the country is, 
            the more money people have to give away. And so 
            all problems end up being balanced out because 
            citizens are willing to pay money to solve society’s 
            issues, and the entrepreneurs will be there to take 
            people’s money and give them what they want. And so, 
            in terms of self-driving vehicles, the Bright Cars 
            should be left alone, with minimal government intervention, 
            to produce their cars. The government invests the money, 
            Bright Cars returns a profit. The market will balance 
            itself out. People will be free to do whatever 
            they want with the self-driving cars. 
            <br><br>
            But how would this be implemented?

                        Bribe and finance all the major news media 
                        corporations to prevent them from ever

                        in this project, as well as helping to crush 
                        anyone speaking out against it and labelling 
                        the opposition as extremists.
