            In this scenario, President Frank McDonnald 
            completely changed the automobile industry in his 
            country, crushing many of the companies that 
            produced non-self-driving cars. There was a 
            lot of political unrest because a huge part of 
            the country felt unheard. However, these people 
            were labelled as crazy people because the policies 
            established by President Frank McDonnald did make 
            the country safer. However, many people lost their 
            jobs since the population was not consulted and had 
            no voice, and many people in the country felt bitterness 
            toward the government for this approach to the issue.
