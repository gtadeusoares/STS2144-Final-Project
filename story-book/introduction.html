        <p>
            John Love was a recently married young man who had just 
            finished college and landed an entry-level job at a start-up 
            that was aiming to revolutionize the world - “Bright Cars”, 
            a self-driving car company that promised to bring the next 
            generation of automobiles to the industry. 
            <br><br>
            John married a bright and beautiful young woman named 
            Jane, who always saw the best in John even though he was 
            a mediocre man. Love is blind, as they say. Jane thought 
            that John had a hidden interiority, which perhaps was 
            hidden even from himself. When with Jane, John was very 
            energetic and friendly, he would feel motivated to challenge 
            himself, he would even have brighter thoughts. But when he 
            was by himself, he would be just an average guy; maybe 
            below average. He wouldn’t think anything clever, or do 
            anything productive. And so, once the honey-moon effect 
            had left the young couple, Jane found herself married to an 
            uninteresting young man who was not particularly bright or industrious. 
            <br><br>
            Jane grew sad while John grew more distant until one day, 
            Jane decided to bring it all up to John. The couple had a 
            long discussion that profoundly impacted John. John loved 
            Jane with all of his heart, and he knew deep down that she was 
            right. He needed to work on himself, he needed to be more 
            industrious, to develop skills to provide for their blossoming 
            family, he needed to be smart, to become the leader he was 
            always meant to be. He also knew that Jane was feeling unloved 
            and that he had to show her that their old flames were still 
            present in the relationship. He could not let her think that 
            he gave up on her. But one cannot fix every single problem by magic, so,

                        John focused on getting his act together professionally. 
                        He knew that Jane would admire him if he became more 
                        successful financially. Jane wants a leader and a 
                        protector, and the best way to provide for Jane 
                        and for the family they were building is for 
                        John to focus on developing himself professionally 
                        and intellectually. Sure sometimes Jane might feel 
                        like he was spending too much time on work, maybe 
                        even obsessing about it, but at least she would 
                        appreciate his effort and she would know that he was 
                        doing it for her and for the family.

                        John focused on making Jane feel loved everyday. 
                        John’s priority was to let Jane know that she 
                        is the love of his life, and he wants her to 
                        never feel sad again. John will focus on his 
                        communication skills, on his enthusiasm, on 
                        being more patient, more loving toward his 
                        wife and those around him. Sure his work might 
                        suffer a little and he may sometimes miss 
                        opportunities due to the extra effort he makes 
                        in being kind and generous to others, but he 
                        knew Jane would appreciate the attention and 
                        intention to make her and their family happy.
