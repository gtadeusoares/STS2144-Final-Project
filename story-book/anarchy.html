            In this scenario, President Frank 
            McDonnald and John Love completely changed 
            the automobile industry in their country. 
            Millions of self-driving cars were produced, 
            with all sorts of different perks, features, 
            and peculiarities. The cars released often 
            malfunctioned, but that is a small price to 
            pay when you are trying to ship your product 
            out as soon as possible. Besides, the customers 
            could always send their faulty car to one of 
            Bright Car’s repair shops. People were mostly 
            left to themselves to use the car however they 
            wanted. This led to a sharp increase in the 
            death rate by accidents with self-driving cars, 
            but that was not really a great concern for the 
            president and Bright Car’s investors and CEO, 
            since everyone in the country benefited financially 
            from the aggressive investment in the country’s automobile industry.
