            For the final project, 
            you will create a game book inspired by 
            design fiction. Design fiction, “incorporates 
            speculative fiction and prototyping, juxtaposing 
            materials and narrative to visualize and start 
            conversations about a particular scenario (Bleecker, 2009). 
            We use it not to imagine a future technology necessarily 
            but, drawing on Langdon Winner (1986), to imagine forms 
            of life that might materialize.” 
            <br><br>        
            For this assignment, students will 
            create a book in the format of “Welcome to 
            Vanguard Estates,” a choose-your-own adventure 
            style book that presents the ethical challenges 
            relating to using artificial intelligence technology 
            for care of the elderly. Your game book can take many 
            forms, such as a word document, slides, an interactive 
            web site, or an app. You will work on this project in small groups. 
            <br><br>
            <strong>Your narrative should have: </strong>
            <br>characters 
            <br>at least one technology 
            <br>multiple decision points and endings (at least 3). 
            <br><br>
            For example, one negative or techno-dystopia ending, 
            one uncertain, and one positive ending. 
            <br><br>
            Your book should also show ethical tensions 
            that we have discussed in class and covered in 
            the readings and assignments, such as tensions 
            between respecting duty, virtue, and justice. You 
            should also include a brief, one page summary at the 
            end of your book that summarizes how your book illustrates 
            ethical tensions and key concepts from course materials.
